# Some likelihoods for the ECLAIR suite

**Author: Louis Perenon**

## Purpose

The ECLAIR suite can be found at https://github.com/s-ilic/ECLAIR. The likelihoods present in this repository were developped during research projects. They complement the ones already contained in the ECLAIR suite.

## Likelihoods

 * CR_BOSS: clustering ratio with BOSS DR7 and DR12 data.
     - likelihood XXX
     - clustering ratio https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.2365
     - BOSS DR7 catalogue https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0649
     - BOSS DR12 catalogue https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00963
     - BOSS DR7 and DR12 clustering ratio data: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.02886
